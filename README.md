This web application is an interactive number guessing game where the user generates a secret number, and the computer attempts to guess it.

At the start of the game, the user thinks of or enters a number within a specified range. Once the game begins, the computer makes a series of guesses to identify the user’s number. After each guess, the user can provide feedback (such as whether the guess is too high or too low), allowing the computer to intelligently adjust its next guess.
